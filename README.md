# Roshambo
Create a game of Roshambo (rock, paper, scissors) which can be played on the command line. Separate functionality into multiple classes. When you run the script, it should do something like the following:  $ node main.js --move=rock Playing a game of Roshambo against the computer. Player plays rock! Computer plays paper! ~Computer wins.~ You may want to use the yargs  package to help with handling command line arguments and flags.
